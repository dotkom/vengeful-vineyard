# Vengeful Vineyard

:wine_glass: Welcome to Vengeful Vineyard! :angry:

## Description

This project was created for the sole purpose of :boom: punishing members in the student organization <i>Online Linjeforening</i> whenever they fail to perform their respective tasks. Their failure shall be documented on our page as a 'vinstraff'(wine punishment). While we already have a functioning site called [RedWine](https://online.ntnu.no/redwine/), that page is old and outdated, and does not provide all the functions we wish it had - hence the need for an updated system.

## Installation - Git Repository and Setup

Run the following code in Git Bash:

```bash
git config user.name "<your github username>"
git config user.email your.github@email.com
git clone https://github.com/dotkom/vengeful-vineyard.git
cd vengeful-vineyard
```

### Installation for Frontend and Backend

You need npm, pip and Python3 installed on your computer.

A separate README.md for installation can be found inside frontend/ and backend/.
For now, we have a mock API as our backend that can be found inside frontend/mock_api.
