# Vengeful Vineyard

## Description

Welcome to :wine_glass: Vengeful Vineyard :angry:. This project was created for the sole purpose of :boom: punishing members in the student organization Online Linjeforening whenever they fail to perform their respective tasks. While we already have a functioning page called [RedWine](https://online.ntnu.no/redwine/), this page is old and outdated, and does not provide all the functions we wish it had - hence the need for an updated system.

## Installation - git repository and setup

```bash
git config user.name "<your github username>"
git config user.email your.github@email.com
git clone https://github.com/dotkom/vengeful-vineyard.git
cd vengeful-vineyard
```

### Installation for Frontend and Backend

You need npm, pip and Python3 installed on your computer.

A separate README.md for installation can be found inside frontend/ and (coming soon<sup>tm</sup>) backend/.
For now, we have a mock API as our backend which can be found inside frontend/mock_api.
